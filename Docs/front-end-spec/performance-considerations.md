# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds for initial app launch
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for button taps and navigation
- **Animation FPS:** 60fps for all animations and transitions

## Design Strategies
- **Lazy Loading**: Load chart data and images asynchronously
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Show basic content first, enhance with animations
- **Efficient Rendering**: Use SwiftUI's built-in optimization features
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of unused resources promptly
- **Reduced Motion**: Provide alternative visual feedback for accessibility

# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

**Architecture Reference:** This comprehensive brownfield architecture document provides the foundation for Phase 2 enhancement implementation.

**Key Integration Requirements Validated:**
- New features integrate seamlessly with existing SwiftUI + Core Data architecture
- All new components follow existing MVVM-C patterns and naming conventions
- Core Data schema changes are additive only, maintaining backward compatibility
- New features maintain existing Apple HIG compliance and accessibility standards

**Existing System Constraints Based on Analysis:**
- Must maintain existing Core Data schema compatibility
- Must preserve existing UserDefaults settings and preferences
- Must maintain existing UI/UX patterns and design system
- Must maintain existing performance requirements (60fps animations, <2s load times)

**First Story to Implement:** iOS Widget Implementation (Story 1.1 from PRD)
- Start with WidgetManager component and BalanceWidget
- Integrate with existing CoreDataStack and TransactionRepository
- Maintain existing data access patterns and error handling

**Emphasis on System Integrity:** All new features must be implemented as extensions to existing architecture without disrupting current functionality. Use feature flags for gradual rollout and easy rollback if needed.

## Developer Handoff

**Architecture and Standards Reference:** This architecture document and existing coding standards from the analyzed codebase provide the implementation foundation.

**Integration Requirements with Existing Codebase:**
- Extend existing SwiftUI views and ViewModels following MVVM-C patterns
- Use existing Core Data patterns for new data models and repositories
- Maintain existing error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- Follow existing file organization and naming conventions

**Key Technical Decisions Based on Project Constraints:**
- Use WidgetKit for iOS Widget implementation with existing Core Data integration
- Extend existing chart components with Swift Charts for advanced analytics

**Existing System Compatibility Requirements:**
- All new features must maintain existing Core Data schema compatibility
- New components must follow existing accessibility and Apple HIG standards
- Performance must not degrade existing 60fps animations and <2s load times
- All new features must work with existing notification and haptic feedback systems

**Implementation Sequencing to Minimize Risk:**
1. **Phase 1:** iOS Widget implementation (lowest risk, extends existing data access)
2. **Phase 2:** Advanced Analytics dashboard (medium risk, extends existing charts)

Each phase should include comprehensive testing and user feedback collection before proceeding to the next phase.

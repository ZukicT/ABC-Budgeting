# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

## Enhancement Overview
**Enhancement Type:** iOS Feature Enhancement Suite
**Scope:** Phase 2 features including iOS Widgets and advanced analytics
**Integration Impact:** Low - New features integrate with existing architecture without requiring major changes to core systems

## Integration Approach
**Code Integration Strategy:** New features will extend existing SwiftUI views and ViewModels, maintaining MVVM-C architecture patterns
**Database Integration:** New features will extend existing Core Data models without breaking current schema. Use Core Data migrations for any required schema changes
**API Integration:** No external API dependencies. All functionality remains local with potential future CloudKit integration for data sync
**UI Integration:** New features will integrate with existing SwiftUI views and ViewModels, maintaining MVVM-C architecture patterns

## Compatibility Requirements
- **Existing API Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility with existing Core Data schema and migration support for future updates
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility with existing UserDefaults settings and preferences
- **UI/UX Consistency:** Maintain compatibility with existing UI/UX patterns and design system (including NO drop shadows policy)
- **Performance Impact:** New features must not impact existing performance requirements (60fps animations, <2s load times)

# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

## Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** Native iOS app through App Store with local Core Data persistence
**Infrastructure Tools:** Xcode, iOS Simulator, TestFlight
**Environments:** Development, TestFlight, App Store

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach:** Integrate new features into existing app bundle with separate target for Widget
**Infrastructure Changes:** Add Widget target to existing Xcode project
**Pipeline Integration:** Extend existing build process to include Widget compilation

## Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method:** Feature flags to disable new features if issues arise
**Risk Mitigation:** Gradual rollout of new features with user feedback collection
**Monitoring:** App Store analytics and user feedback monitoring

# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing ABC Budgeting with Phase 2 iOS features including Widgets and advanced analytics. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development of new features while ensuring seamless integration with the existing system.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements existing project architecture by defining how new components will integrate with current systems. Where conflicts arise between new and existing patterns, this document provides guidance on maintaining consistency while implementing enhancements.

## Existing Project Analysis

### Current Project State
- **Primary Purpose:** Comprehensive financial tracking iOS application for users aged 18-40 seeking simple financial control
- **Current Tech Stack:** SwiftUI + Core Data + iOS 18+ + Swift 6
- **Architecture Style:** MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) pattern with modular structure
- **Deployment Method:** Native iOS app through App Store with local Core Data persistence

### Available Documentation
- **Project Brief** (comprehensive - 261 lines) - Complete strategic overview
- **PRD** (comprehensive - 358 lines) - Detailed requirements with 30 FRs, 15 NFRs, 8 CRs
- **Front End Specification** (comprehensive - 699 lines) - Complete UI/UX specifications with Apple HIG compliance
- **Technical Architecture** (SwiftUI + Core Data, MVVM-C pattern) - Existing implementation
- **Design System** (Apple HIG compliant, professional flat design with NO drop shadows) - Current UI standards
- **User Flow Documentation** (complete 4-tab interface) - Navigation patterns
- **Build Configuration** (successful compilation confirmed) - Ready for enhancement

### Identified Constraints

# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI
New UI elements will seamlessly integrate with the existing professional flat design system, maintaining consistency with the established color palette, typography, and component patterns. All new features will follow the same visual hierarchy and spacing principles established in the current design system.

## Modified/New Screens and Views
- **Overview Tab**: Enhanced with additional chart visualizations and improved data presentation
- **Settings Tab**: Extended with new configuration options for Phase 2 features
- **New Widget Interface**: iOS Widget screens for quick balance and goal overview

## UI Consistency Requirements
- Maintain existing color scheme and typography throughout all new interfaces
- Ensure consistent button styles, card layouts, and navigation patterns
- Preserve existing accessibility standards and VoiceOver support
- Maintain professional flat design principles across all new features **with NO drop shadows**
- Ensure responsive design that works across all supported device sizes

# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: Swift 6  
**Frameworks**: SwiftUI, Core Data, UserNotifications, WidgetKit, Swift Charts  
**Database**: Core Data with local persistence  
**Infrastructure**: iOS 18+ native app  
**External Dependencies**: Swift Collections, Swift Async Algorithms  

## Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: New features will extend existing Core Data models without breaking current schema. Use Core Data migrations for any required schema changes.

**API Integration Strategy**: No external API dependencies. All functionality remains local with potential future CloudKit integration for data sync.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: New features will integrate with existing SwiftUI views and ViewModels, maintaining MVVM-C architecture patterns.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: New features will include unit tests and UI tests following existing testing patterns and coverage requirements.

## Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: New features will follow existing modular structure with separate folders for Widgets, Watch app, and Siri integration.

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing Swift naming conventions and file organization patterns established in the current codebase.

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing Swift style guide compliance and code formatting standards.

**Documentation Standards**: All new features will include comprehensive documentation following existing patterns and Apple's documentation guidelines.

## Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: New features will integrate with existing Xcode build process and CI/CD pipeline.

**Deployment Strategy**: Features will be deployed through standard iOS App Store submission process with proper versioning.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Maintain existing logging patterns and add appropriate monitoring for new features.

**Configuration Management**: New features will use existing UserDefaults and Core Data configuration patterns.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: 
- Widget performance impact on main app
- Apple Watch battery usage optimization
- Siri integration complexity

**Integration Risks**: 
- Core Data migration issues
- UI consistency across different platforms
- User experience fragmentation

**Deployment Risks**: 
- App Store review process for new features
- User adoption of new functionality
- Performance impact on existing features

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Comprehensive testing across all platforms
- Gradual rollout of new features
- User feedback collection and iteration
- Performance monitoring and optimization

# Stories Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete workflow for managing user stories in the ABC Budgeting project, from creation to completion.

## Story Lifecycle

```
[Backlog] → [Active] → [Code Review] → [Completed]
```

### 1. Backlog Phase
- Stories are created and defined
- Acceptance criteria are established
- Technical requirements are documented
- Dependencies are identified
- Priority and effort are estimated

### 2. Active Phase
- Story is assigned to a developer
- Development work begins
- Regular progress updates
- Implementation details are documented
- Testing is performed

### 3. Code Review Phase
- Development is complete
- Code review is performed
- Feedback is provided and addressed
- Final verification is done
- Quality gates are checked

### 4. Completed Phase
- Story is fully implemented and accepted
- Documentation is complete
- Story is archived for reference
- Metrics are recorded

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Creating a New Story

1. **Use Template**: Start with appropriate template from `/templates/`
2. **Fill Details**: Complete all required information
3. **Review**: Have story reviewed by team lead
4. **Place in Backlog**: Add to appropriate backlog location
5. **Assign Priority**: Set priority and effort estimation

### Starting Development

1. **Assign Developer**: Assign story to available developer
2. **Move to Active**: Copy story to `/active/` folder
3. **Update Status**: Change status to "Active"
4. **Create Branch**: Create feature branch following naming convention
5. **Begin Work**: Start implementation following story requirements

### During Development

1. **Update Progress**: Regularly update implementation log
2. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to coding standards and architecture
3. **Write Tests**: Create appropriate tests as you develop
4. **Document Changes**: Document any deviations or discoveries
5. **Regular Commits**: Commit work regularly with descriptive messages

### Completing Development

1. **Verify Criteria**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
2. **Run Tests**: Execute all tests and ensure they pass
3. **Code Review**: Self-review code against standards
4. **Update Documentation**: Complete implementation notes
5. **Move to Code Review**: Copy story to `/code-review/` folder

### Code Review Process

1. **Assign Reviewer**: Assign appropriate reviewer
2. **Review Code**: Use code review checklist
3. **Provide Feedback**: Document all feedback
4. **Address Issues**: Developer addresses feedback
5. **Re-review**: Reviewer verifies fixes
6. **Approve**: Approve when all issues resolved

### Final Completion

1. **Move to Completed**: Copy story to `/completed/` folder
2. **Update Status**: Change status to "Completed"
3. **Record Metrics**: Document performance and quality metrics
4. **Archive**: Story is permanently archived
5. **Celebrate**: Acknowledge completion

## File Management

### Moving Stories Between Folders

#### To Active
```bash
cp "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/backlog/story-name.md" "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/active/"
```

#### To Code Review
```bash
cp "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/active/story-name.md" "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/code-review/"
```

#### To Completed
```bash
cp "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/code-review/story-name.md" "ABC Budgeting/Docs/stories/completed/"
```

### File Naming Convention
- Format: `{epic-number}-{story-number}-{short-description}.md`
- Examples:
  - `1-1-ios-widget-implementation.md`
  - `1-2-advanced-analytics-dashboard.md`
  - `1-3-enhanced-notification-system.md`

## Technical Dependencies

### Data Layer Dependencies
- **Story 1.4** → **Story 1.1**: Widget data models required for widget implementation
- **Story 1.5** → **Story 1.2**: Analytics data models required for analytics dashboard

### Framework Dependencies
- **WidgetKit**: Required for iOS widgets (iOS 14+)
- **Swift Charts**: Required for analytics visualizations (iOS 16+)
- **UserNotifications**: Required for notification system (iOS 10+)
- **Core Data**: Required for all data persistence

### Architecture Dependencies
- **MVVM-C Pattern**: All stories must follow existing architecture
- **Core Data Stack**: All stories must integrate with existing data layer
- **SwiftUI**: All UI components must use SwiftUI
- **Apple HIG**: All UI must follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines

## Quality Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- Widget updates: < 1 second

- Notification scheduling: < 100ms
- Overall app performance: 60fps animations, < 2s load times

### Accessibility Requirements
- Full VoiceOver support
- Dynamic Type support (12pt-34pt)
- Color contrast compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- Touch targets: 44pt minimum
- Dark mode support

### Integration Requirements
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatibility with existing data
- Consistent UI/UX with existing design system
- Maintain existing performance standards

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

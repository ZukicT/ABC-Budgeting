# ABC Budgeting Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

**SCOPE ASSESSMENT:** 
Based on our brainstorming session, ABC Budgeting appears to be a substantial enhancement requiring comprehensive planning with multiple coordinated stories (your 4-week roadmap with 16 V1 features). This justifies using the full brownfield PRD process rather than simpler alternatives.

**PROJECT CONTEXT:**
I can see from our brainstorming session that you have a well-established iOS app with:
- MVVM + Coordinator architecture
- SwiftUI-based UI with established design system
- Core Data requirements for persistence
- Defined feature set needing implementation completion

### Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** Brainstorming session output and user-provided technical specifications

**Current Project State:**
ABC Budgeting is a native iOS personal finance app with solid architectural foundation but currently operating with mock data. The app has established UI patterns (particularly in the overview tab), comprehensive data models, and clear technical constraints. Primary purpose is expense tracking, income management, and visual savings goal progress with a focus on user simplicity.

## Project Context & Current State

### Project Overview
ABC Budgeting is a native iOS personal finance app focused on expense tracking, income management, and visual savings goal progress. The app empowers users to make informed financial decisions through clear insights and analytics.

### Current Technical Foundation
- **Architecture:** MVVM + Coordinator pattern with modular structure
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI-only (iOS 18+, Swift 6)
- **Design System:** Blue #0a38c3 primary, green #07e95e secondary, SF Pro Rounded typography
- **Data Models:** Transaction, GoalFormData, TransactionCategory with comprehensive categorization
- **Visualizations:** Income required charts, spending breakdown donut charts, progress tracking
- **Current State:** Mostly built with solid foundation but using mock data, needs Core Data integration and feature completion

### Technical Constraints
- iOS 18+ only, Swift 6, SwiftUI-only (no UIKit)
- MVVM-C architecture with Repository pattern
- Core Data for persistence, Keychain for sensitive data
- Offline-first design, no external APIs
- Native iOS Charts for visualizations
- Light/Dark mode adaptation, Spring animations

## Core Vision & User Needs Analysis

### User Vision (First Principles Analysis)
**Simple financial app that helps users:**
- Make savings goals
- Track expenses and recurring payments/income
- See where money is going and coming from
- Understand income requirements based on lifestyle

### Essential User Input Methods
- Quick add buttons (+ Income, - Expense) with simple forms
- Amount, category, and date entry
- Recurring transaction toggle with auto-suggestions

### Categorization & Visualization Strategy
- 6 color-coded categories (Food, Leisure, Bills, etc.)
- Donut chart showing spending breakdown
- Balance card for current status
- Monthly trend line showing money flow over time
- Income breakdown (hours to yearly based on expenses/lifestyle)

### Most Critical Missing Components
1. Core Data integration and persistence
2. Transaction CRUD operations with proper state management
3. Real data flow (currently mock data only)
4. UI consistency across all tabs
5. User onboarding flow
6. Push notifications for financial reminders

## Priority Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1 - Critical Foundation (P1)
1. **Core Data Stack** - Without persistence, app is just a demo
2. **Transaction CRUD Operations** - Add/Edit/Delete transactions with proper state management
3. **Basic Data Validation** - Prevent invalid entries and provide user feedback

### Week 2 - Core Functionality (P2)
1. **Proper State Management** - Data flows correctly between views using @Observable
2. **Settings & Preferences** - Currency selection, baseline balance, user preferences
3. **Error Handling** - Network errors, validation failures, user-friendly messages

### Week 3 - Enhanced Features (P3)
1. **Recurring Transactions** - Simple recurring logic with skip/edit options
2. **Push Notifications** - Core alerts for new transactions, upcoming/recurring items
3. **UI Polish** - Basic visual consistency across all tabs

### Week 4 - Launch Preparation (P4)
1. **User Onboarding** - Basic setup with minor feature explanations
2. **Performance Optimization** - Large dataset handling, smooth animations
3. **Testing & Bug Fixes** - Comprehensive testing, edge case handling

## Comprehensive Feature Divergence Matrix

### V1 Launch-Ready Features (Green)

## Implementation Strategy & Key Decisions

### Critical V1 Implementation Order
1. **Foundation First:** Core Data + CRUD operations (Week 1)
2. **Notifications Early:** Basic notifications + recurring logic (Week 2)
3. **UI Consistency:** Polish across all tabs using overview tab as design foundation (Week 3)
4. **User Experience:** Onboarding + final testing (Week 4)

### Design System Approach
- **Overview Tab as Foundation:** Use current overview tab design patterns as the standard
- **Basic Polish First:** Focus on visual consistency before advanced animations
- **Progressive Enhancement:** V1 gets basic polish, V2+ gets advanced visual refinements

### Scope Validation Decisions
1. **Design vs Functionality:** Complete basic visual polish, then focus on functionality improvements
2. **Onboarding Complexity:** Basic setup only with minor feature explanations for V1
3. **Transaction Management:** V1 requires full CRUD (add/edit/delete) functionality
4. **Notifications:** All basic notifications are critical for V1 launch (new transactions, upcoming/recurring)

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Begin Week 1 Foundation Work** - Start with Core Data stack implementation
2. **Document Current UI Patterns** - Catalog overview tab design elements for consistency reference
3. **Plan Notification Strategy** - Define core notification types and timing
4. **Set Up Development Environment** - Ensure proper testing setup for Core Data integration

### Development Workflow Recommendation
Consider transitioning to BMad brownfield workflow to create:
- Structured enhancement documentation
- Story-by-story implementation plan
- Development guidance for each feature
- Systematic approach to completing the existing codebase

### Risk Mitigation
- **Core Data Complexity:** Start with simple CRUD operations before advanced features
- **UI Consistency:** Document design patterns early to avoid rework
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to V1 feature matrix to ensure launch readiness
- **Testing Strategy:** Implement basic testing alongside feature development

## Session Insights & Learnings

### What Worked Well
- Clear project vision and technical constraints
- Realistic 4-week implementation timeline
- Focus on user simplicity over feature complexity
- Systematic approach to feature prioritization

### Areas for Further Exploration
- Core Data implementation strategy and best practices
- Push notification permission and user experience flow
- Performance optimization techniques for financial data
- App Store submission and launch preparation

### Questions That Emerged
- Should Core Data implementation start with simple in-memory testing?
- How detailed should V1 error handling be versus V2+ improvements?
- What's the optimal user onboarding flow length for financial apps?
- How can recurring transaction logic be kept simple but effective?

## Conclusion

ABC Budgeting has a solid technical foundation and clear user vision. The 4-week implementation roadmap focuses on completing essential functionality while maintaining the app's simplicity principle. The feature divergence matrix provides clear V1 vs V2+ scope boundaries, ensuring a realistic launch timeline while preserving opportunities for future enhancement.

**Bottom Line:** Focus on Core Data integration and basic functionality completion first, then polish the user experience across all tabs using the overview tab as the design standard. The app is well-positioned for a successful V1 launch with the identified scope.

# Refined Story Breakdown - ABC Budgeting

## Overview

This document provides the refined breakdown of large stories identified in the Scrum Master analysis. Large stories have been split into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve development velocity and reduce risk.

## Story Breakdown Rationale

### Why Break Down Large Stories?
- **Better Estimation:** Smaller stories are easier to estimate accurately
- **Reduced Risk:** Smaller stories have lower risk of failure
- **Improved Velocity:** Smaller stories complete faster
- **Better Quality:** More focused stories lead to better quality
- **Easier Testing:** Smaller stories are easier to test thoroughly

### Breakdown Criteria
- **Story Points:** Target 3-8 points per story
- **Duration:** Target 1-3 days per story
- **Dependencies:** Minimize cross-story dependencies
- **Testing:** Each story should be independently testable
- **Value:** Each story should deliver user value

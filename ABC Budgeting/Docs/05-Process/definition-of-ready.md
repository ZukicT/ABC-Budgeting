- Architecture alignment verified
- Performance impact evaluated

### 3. Design Review
- UX/UI designer reviews story
- Design requirements defined
- User flow documented
- Accessibility requirements specified

### 4. Quality Review
- QA lead reviews story

- Resources allocated

## DoR Exceptions

### Emergency Stories
- Critical bug fixes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Production issues
- **Process:** Expedited review, minimal DoR requirements

### Small Stories
- Simple bug fixes
- Minor improvements
- Documentation updates
- **Process:** Simplified DoR checklist

### Research Stories
- Technical spikes

- **Reduced Rework:** Clear requirements reduce changes during development
- **Better Quality:** Comprehensive requirements lead to better outcomes
- **Improved Velocity:** Well-prepared stories move through development faster
- **Team Satisfaction:** Clear requirements reduce frustration and confusion

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and approve this DoR document
2. Train team on DoR process
3. Apply DoR to existing stories
4. Monitor and improve DoR effectiveness
5. Continuously refine DoR criteria

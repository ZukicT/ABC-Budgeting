## Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

Based on your existing architecture and the defined enhancement scope, the integration approach will build upon your established modular structure while implementing the missing Core Data persistence layer and completing the Services implementation.

**Enhancement Overview:**
- **Enhancement Type:** Core Data integration + feature completion
- **Scope:** Transform existing mock data system to production-ready persistence
- **Integration Impact:** Moderate - adding missing layers without changing established UI patterns

**Integration Approach:**

**Code Integration Strategy:** Implement the pending `Core/Services/` and `Core/Persistence/` layers using your established Repository pattern. ViewModels will transition from mock data to Repository-based data access while maintaining existing @Observable patterns.

**Database Integration:** Add Core Data stack in `Core/Persistence/` with repositories for Transaction, GoalFormData, and TransactionCategory models. Maintain existing model structures to preserve UI compatibility.

**UI Integration Strategy:** Preserve all existing Views and navigation coordinators. Update ViewModels to use new Services layer instead of mock data, maintaining current state management patterns.

**Notification Integration:** Add NotificationService to `Core/Services/` that integrates with existing NotificationItem model and coordinates with transaction scheduling.

## Compatibility Requirements

**Existing System Compatibility:**
- **File Structure Preservation:** All enhancements fit within your established directory structure without reorganization
- **MVVM-C Pattern Maintenance:** Existing coordinators and ViewModels remain unchanged in structure
- **SwiftUI Component Compatibility:** All existing Views in `Modules/` continue working with Repository data
- **Design System Preservation:** Maintain established color palette (#0a38c3, #07e95e) and typography from `Resources/`

## Tech Stack Alignment

**Existing Technology Stack:**
Your current stack perfectly aligns with brownfield requirements:

| Category | Current Technology | Version | Enhancement Notes |
|----------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Language | Swift | 6 | Maintained |
| UI Framework | SwiftUI | iOS 18+ | Preserved exclusively |
| Architecture | MVVM-C | Current | Enhanced with Services layer |
| Persistence | Core Data | To be added | Implementing in Core/Persistence/ |
| Navigation | Coordinator Pattern | Current | MainTabCoordinator preserved |
| State Management | @Observable | Current | Extended to Repository pattern |

## Data Models and Schema Integration

Based on your existing `Core/Models/` structure, the Core Data integration will enhance rather than replace your current models:

**Existing Model Enhancement:**
- **Transaction.swift** → Core Data entity with relationships
- **GoalFormData.swift** → Core Data entity for goal persistence  
- **TransactionCategory** → Core Data entity with category relationships
- **NotificationItem.swift** → Enhanced for Core Data notification scheduling

**Schema Integration Strategy:**

**Database Changes Required:**
- **New Core Data Stack:** Implement in `Core/Persistence/CoreDataStack.swift`
- **Repository Layer:** Add `Core/Persistence/Repositories/` for data access abstraction
- **Model Extensions:** Extend existing models for Core Data compatibility
- **Migration Strategy:** Initial schema creation (no migration needed for new implementation)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing ViewModels continue using same model interfaces
- UI components require no changes to work with persisted data
- Navigation and coordination patterns remain identical

## Component Architecture

Based on your established modular structure, the enhanced components will integrate seamlessly with your existing organization:

### New Components

### Component Integration Strategy

Your existing coordinator pattern in `MainTabCoordinator.swift` remains unchanged. The integration flow will be:

1. **ViewModels** (existing) → **Services** (new) → **Repositories** (new) → **Core Data** (new)
2. **Views** (existing) continue using ViewModels with @Observable patterns
3. **Coordinators** (existing) handle navigation without modification

## Source Tree Integration

- **Security Tools:** iOS data protection classes, device encryption

**Enhancement Security Requirements:**

**New Security Measures:**
- Core Data encryption using iOS data protection
- Keychain integration for Core Data encryption keys if needed
- Local data backup encryption through iOS backup encryption

**Integration Points:**
- Core Data persistence respects iOS data protection classes
- Notification scheduling follows iOS permission patterns
- Settings preferences continue using established keychain patterns

**Compliance Requirements:** iOS App Store guidelines, no additional regulatory requirements for local-only financial tracking

### Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** Device security validation, keychain access testing
**New Security Test Requirements:** Core Data encryption validation, backup/restore security
**Penetration Testing:** iOS security model validation (device-level protection sufficient)

## Next Steps

### Story Manager Handoff

Based on this architecture analysis, proceed with story creation using the established PRD. Key integration requirements validated:

- Core Data implementation fits cleanly into `Core/Persistence/` structure
- Service layer implementation uses established `Core/Services/` organization  
- All existing Views and Coordinators remain unchanged during enhancement
- Repository pattern integration follows your established dependency injection approaches

The architecture supports the sequential story implementation: Core Data foundation → Service layer → UI integration → notifications → onboarding.

### Developer Handoff

Architecture analysis confirms your existing codebase is well-structured for the planned enhancements:

- Established MVVM-C patterns will accommodate Repository integration cleanly
- Modular structure allows isolated implementation of missing persistence layer
- Clear separation between UI and data layers minimizes integration risk
- Existing coordinator navigation patterns require no modification

Implementation should follow your established priority sequence with confidence that architectural patterns support the enhancement scope without requiring structural changes to working components.

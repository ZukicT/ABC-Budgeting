# Font Files Directory

This directory should contain the Trap font family files:

- Trap-Black.otf
- Trap-Bold.otf
- Trap-ExtraBold.otf
- Trap-Light.otf
- Trap-Medium.otf
- Trap-Regular.otf
- Trap-SemiBold.otf

## How to Add Fonts:

1. Copy all 7 Trap font files (.otf) into this directory
2. Make sure they are added to the Xcode project target
3. The Info.plist is already configured to load these fonts
4. The app will automatically use Trap fonts with fallback to system fonts

## Testing Fonts:

The app includes a font verification system that will log to the console whether fonts loaded successfully.
